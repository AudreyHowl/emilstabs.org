## Editing transcriptions

Feel free to suggest edits to any of the files in the project.  To do so: 

1. Browse to the file you want to edit and click the "Edit" button near the top of the file.  
2. Make your changes, then click "Propose File Change." 
3. On the next page, click "Send pull request" to send a request to have your changes merged back into the main project. If you've changed your mind and want to delete your changes, click on the "Branches" tab and delete the branch.
4. Once your request has been accepted, you can delete the old branch.

## Submitting a new transcription
