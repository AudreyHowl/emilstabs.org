G                      Cm
I close my eyes as the curtain draws
G
Ear toward the tracks
G                  Cm
And ever after the rhythm soars
G
Flyin' right past the facts
F
Hold the times that I brought to light
Em
Keep the pattern till June
Eb                  F
Make the other side right
                    G
Half the way to the Moon

G                   Cm
I'm old enough to repeat myself
G
I'm not tryin' to defend
G                Cm
Holdin' onto the thoughts I have
G
Back to circles again
F
Holdin' back the emotion train
Em
Headin' back to Duluth
Eb
All aboard for the tour
F                  G
Ridin' next to the truth

C                      Ab
I found a place that I cant explain
C
In my state of mind
Bb
I move myself as I search the stone
Am
For any lines to unwind
Bb
I grabbed some change when I thought I could
F
Left my wallet behind
D
I did my best to refine
F
I put my shoes out to shine

G                   Cm
A little star that reveals itself
G
Little matter of time
G                 Cm
Holdin' on to the wheel I know
G
Not the devil I'll find
F
Raise the bar and roof beams high
Em
Keep the pattern til June
Eb                 F
All aboard for the tour
G
Half the way to the moon
