F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B


*I usually throw some alternating B's in there to sound good!


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more promises that no one could keep
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more lies to keep us from sleep
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more phone calls when you don't say what you mean
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
I've got faith in a fairytale, devotion to a dream


E -> B -> F# -> G#m
no more knowing glances or places we can hide
C# -> B -> C#
no more chances to keep this thing alive
E -> B -> F# -> G#m
the two of us together it wasn't in the grand scheme
C# -> B -> C#
all it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
devotion to a dream


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B (Repeat)
(Solo)


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more promises no more keeping score
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
no more wondering what I stay here for


E -> B -> F# -> G#m
we broke the awkward silence with polite and practiced lies
C# -> B -> C#
while images occupied our minds
E -> B -> F# -> G#m
an uneventful voyage that stranded us upstream 
C# -> B -> C#
all it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
devotion to a dream
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
yesterday my path was chosen
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
yesterday my smile was frozen
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
yesterday my doors were closing down


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
tomorrow I can cross the border
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
it's today a new world-order
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
yesterday my will was broken down


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
I'll ignore where this is leading
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
tomorrow glaciers are receding
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
now I'm mending things I broke inside


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
I'm completing thoughts unspoken
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
now I see that webs were woven
F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
now I keep the windows open wide


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
(Jam)


F# *(B) -> G#m -> E -> B
it's today... (Repeat until finish)
